- fix navbar

Today's learning:
  + <NavLink>
  A special version of the <Link> that will add styling attributes to the rendered element when it matches the current URL.

  + react-avatar component exists
  Universal avatar makes it possible to fetch/generate an avatar based on the information you have about that user. We use a fallback system that if for example an invalid Facebook ID is used it will try Google, and so on.

  + react-modal component exists
  Accessible modal dialog component for React.JS

- add react-avatar package (npm install react-avatar)
- add toggle drop down for user avatar logout button

Bug encountered:
  - added a partial for questions view and tried creating a question but
  server was throwing error saying topic must exist after creating topics table

Bug encountered:
  - in my questions reducer, return merge({}, state, {[action.question.id]: action.questions}); instead of `action.question`

Learning:

  that reverses the order of elements in an array
