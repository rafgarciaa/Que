# Que

Que is a full-stack application, inspired by Quora, which allows users to ask and answer other user-generated questions. The technologies used for this application includes Rails as the framework (backend), React/Redux for the frontend and PostGresQL as the database. This project utilizes most (if not all) of our learnings as a student in App Academy.
